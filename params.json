J. (2011). Application of GIS-based multi-criteria analysis for site selection of aquifer recharge with reclaimed water. Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 56(1), 105–116. doi:10.1016/j.resconrec.2011.08.003\r\n\r\n### DETAILS\r\n\r\n- The discovery of one or more sites which are suitable for a given application can be accomplished through a cartographic modeling technique known as weighted overlay analysis. The application of this technique involves the  superposition of multiple spatially referenced data layers, each of which has been interpreted to represent some dimension of site suitability for the application in question. The WOSS toolset provides a number of routines which enable the automated preprocessing of vector and raster GIS datasets into a consistent raster format for later use in another MATLAB based modeling workflow.\r\n\r\n## USAGE \r\n\r\nThere are two principle ways in which the tools contained within the repository can be used. The first such interface is programmatic and involves the manual linkage of the toolsets functions through a MATLAB script. The second interface is graphical and involves calling the packaged GUI.m file and engaging in a pre-structured workflow.  \r\n\r\n### PROGRAMMATIC INTERFACE\r\n\r\nAn sample programatic usage of the toolset is illustrated in the script entitled \"main.m\" and its accompanying parameter file \"main_parameters.m\" which are both located in the \"/smp/\" sub-directory. This script uses a provided set of sample data files contained in the sub-directories of \"/smp/data.\"\r\n\r\n### GRAPHICAL INTERFACE\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
