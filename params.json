The application of this technique involves the  superposition of multiple spatially referenced data layers, each of which has been interpreted to represent some dimension of site suitability for the application in question. The WOSS toolset provides a number of routines which enable the automated preprocessing of vector and raster GIS datasets into \r\n  a consistent raster format for later use in another MATLAB based modeling \r\n  workflow.
